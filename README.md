# Railway Crack Detection

YOLOv8-based detection of rail surface defects (cracks and gaps) from photographs of railway track, with a CLI tool for single-image inference, a training pipeline, and **TRACKSCAN** — a Flask web app for scanning images through the browser.

> Dataset sourced from Roboflow Universe: **[railway-crack-detection-ezd8g-hojvc](https://universe.roboflow.com/23f3001829s-workspace/railway-crack-detection-ezd8g-hojvc)**

<!-- Optional: drop a screenshot or short GIF of TRACKSCAN here, e.g. docs/trackscan-preview.png -->

## Features

- **YOLOv8 detection** — single-class rail defect detector (`railway-gap`), trained with [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- **CLI inference** (`detect.py`) — run detection on a single image from the command line, with full threshold/size/device control
- **Training pipeline** (`trainer.py`) — argparse-driven YOLOv8 training with configurable augmentation, precision, and run tracking
- **TRACKSCAN web app** (`app.py` + `templates/` + `static/`) — drag-and-drop or camera-capture image upload, adjustable scan settings, and live annotated results, usable on both desktop and mobile

## Tech stack

| Layer | Tools |
|---|---|
| Model | Ultralytics YOLOv8, PyTorch |

## STEPS

- >befoure starting the traning put the data in dataset folder in the yolov8 format with matching labels of of image in two seprate folder for each 
- >create a runs folder here all the weights and results will be stored 
- >use "trainer.py --help" to get to know about the args
- >use the detect to detect the gap locally or use the app.py file for the online use by enabling it on your local machine u could access the website on the dedicated link

## Setup

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd Railway-Crack-Detection
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Place your trained weights at the path `detect.py` expects (or pass `--weights` explicitly):

```
pretrained weights/best.pt
```

## Usage

### Web app (TRACKSCAN)

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open **http://127.0.0.1:5000/** in a browser. Upload a rail image (drag-and-drop, tap to select, or capture directly on mobile), optionally adjust confidence/IoU/image size/device in the settings panel, and hit **Scan for defects**. Results — annotated image, defect count, per-detection confidence and bounding box — render in place.

> Load the app through this URL, not through a separate static-file server (e.g. VS Code Live Server). A different server on a different port can't reach `/api/predict` and will return `405 Method Not Allowed`.

### CLI detection

```bash
python detect.py --input path/to/image.jpg
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--input` | *(required)* | Path to the input image |
| `--weights` | `pretrained weights/best.pt` | Path to trained `.pt` weights |
| `--output` | `results/<name>_detected.<ext>` | Output image path |
| `--conf` | `0.10` | Confidence threshold |
| `--iou` | `0.45` | IoU threshold for NMS |
| `--imgsz` | `960` | Inference image size |
| `--max-det` | `100` | Max detections per image |
| `--device` | auto | `0` for GPU, `cpu`, or omit |
| `--show` | off | Display the annotated result in an OpenCV window |

### Training

```bash
python trainer.py --data-yaml dataset/data.yaml --model yolov8s.pt --epochs 100 --batch-size 4
```

Key flags: `--image-size`, `--epochs`, `--patience`, `--batch-size`, `--device`, `--workers` (defaults to `0` for Windows `DataLoader` stability), `--seed`, `--rect`, `--half`, plus augmentation controls (`--degrees`, `--translate`, `--scale`, `--hsv-h/s/v`, `--fliplr`, `--flipud`, `--mosaic`, `--mixup`). Run `python trainer.py --help` for the full list.

Before training starts, `trainer.py` runs a preflight check against `--data-yaml` and points you to `dataset_analyzer.py --check` for deeper dataset validation if that check fails. After training, it validates and (unless `--skip-test`) tests the best checkpoint, then writes `experiment_summary.json` alongside the run.

**Response — error** (400 / 404 / 413 / 500): `{ "error": "..." }`

## Troubleshooting

- **`OMP: Error #15` / process dies mid-request** — PyTorch and OpenCV can each bundle Intel's OpenMP runtime; loading both in one process crashes at the native level. `detect.py` sets `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before importing `ultralytics` to work around this — keep that line if you refactor imports.
- **`405 Method Not Allowed` on `/api/predict`** — the page is being served by something other than `app.py` (commonly a separate static-file server like Live Server on a different port). Load the app from `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, started via `python app.py`.
- **`imgsz=960` and inference speed** — both the CLI and the web app default to `960` for consistency with each other. If your model was trained at a smaller resolution (check `--image-size` in your training run), a smaller `--imgsz` / settings-panel value will run faster with no accuracy cost.

## Description

Training was performed on a local machine equipped with an **11th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU, and 32 GB RAM**. The model was trained for **150 epochs**, and the complete training process took approximately **3.5 hours** on this system.

## Limitation

As we know that in railway track there are few gaps which are intentionally left for the free thermal expansion during the elevated temperature of the surrounding environment causing the metal to expand (gap between railway track is about 3-10 mm, https://railroadrails.com/information/why-gaps-are-left-in-railway-tracks/) these gaps are connected using a fish plate have 4 anchoring point 2 for holding each rail .The model here detects it also as a crack if anyone is willing to correct the issue you could use a cap in the model where if the gap is between the 3-10 mm means that is intentional gap given for thermal expansion not a crack.
